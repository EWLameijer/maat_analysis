= Tools for using Code Maat

== Setting up 
. if `python` (or `py`) doesn't do anything yet on your system, install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
. if `java --version` doesn't do anything yet on your system, install Java (for example, via https://adoptium.net/)
. create a directory on your computer to house the analysis software (say in C:\development\tools)
. in that directory, download the jar-file of code-maat, which will analyze git logs: https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat/releases/tag/v1.0.4
. in the same directory, clone the https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts project
. IMPORTANT: switch the maat-scripts project to the python3 branch 
. in the same directory (C:\development\tools or such), clone this project (https://github.com/EWLameijer/maat_analysis)
. in the same directory, download cloc https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/releases
. go to the /maat_analysis directory, copy `script_paths_example.py` to `script_paths.py`, and adjust the directories and cloc-version to those you are using

== Running an analysis
. and run a script of your choice, like ``python analysis.py``
. if you want to do a hotspot analysis, go to the /maat-scripts/transform directory, and run a web server (like ``python -m http.server``)
