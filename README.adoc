= Tools for using Code Maat

== Setting up 
. If `python` (or `py`) doesn't do anything yet on your system, install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
. If `java --version` doesn't do anything yet on your system, install Java (for example, via https://adoptium.net/).
. Create a directory on your computer to house the analysis software (say in `C:\development\tools`).
. In that directory, download the jar-file of code-maat, which will analyze git logs: https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat/releases/tag/v1.0.4 .
. In the same directory, clone the https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts project.
. IMPORTANT: switch the maat-scripts project to the python3 branch. 
. In the same directory (`C:\development\tools` or such), clone this project (https://github.com/EWLameijer/maat_analysis).
. In the same directory, download cloc (https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/releases).
. Go to the /maat_analysis directory, copy `script_paths_example.py` to `script_paths.py`, and adjust the directories and cloc-version to those you are using.

== Running an analysis
. Run a script of your choice, like `python hotspots.py`.
. If you want to do a hotspot analysis, also go to the /maat-scripts/transform directory, and run a web server (like `python -m http.server`).
