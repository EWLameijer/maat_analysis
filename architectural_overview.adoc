== Goal

file_analysis.py indicates of a file:

* who worked on it 
* which files were changed together with this file 
* complexity statistics 

== Method 

file_analysis reads the various data in from disk, from specially made files.

If those files have not been created yet, it will create them.

The central object for file analysis is the analyzer.Analyzer. It is produced by analyzer.get_analyzer_or_throw, which will take a file; if that file isn't in a git-repo or git-controlled, get_analyzer_or_throw will return throw an Exeption, else it will return an analyzer.Analyzer.
